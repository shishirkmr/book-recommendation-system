Alongside the body, police have found a series of baffling codes. As Langdon and a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, begin to sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to find a trail that leads to the works of Leonardo Da Vinci - and suggests the answer to a mystery that stretches deep into the vault of history. Langdon suspects the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion - a centuries old secret society - and has sacrificed his life to protect the Priory's most sacred trust: the location of a vastly important religious relic hidden for centuries. But it now appears that Opus Dei, a clandestine sect that has long plotted to seize the Prirory's secret, has now made its move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine code and quickly assemble the pieces of the puzzle, the Priory's secret - and a stunning historical truth - will be lost forever... Breaking the mould of traditional suspense novels, The Da Vinci Code is simultaneously lightning-paced, intelligent and intricately layered with remarkable research and detail. And in this exclusive edition Dan Brown allows the reader behind the scenes of the novel which now incorporates over 150 photographs and illustrations throughout the text showing the rich historical tapestry from which he drew his inspiration. The visual sources which provide both the backdrop and the stimulus for the novel's action are revealed for the first time and uniquely complement the reading experience.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780593057711"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0593057716"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 480, "printType": "BOOK", "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.2.0.preview.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t2o9ojS7T10C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t2o9ojS7T10C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=t2o9ojS7T10C&dq=intitle:The+Da+Vinci+Code+inauthor:Dan+Brown&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=t2o9ojS7T10C&dq=intitle:The+Da+Vinci+Code+inauthor:Dan+Brown&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Da_Vinci_Code.html?hl=&id=t2o9ojS7T10C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=t2o9ojS7T10C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]
