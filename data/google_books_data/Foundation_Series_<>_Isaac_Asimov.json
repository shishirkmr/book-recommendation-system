Everyone believed it would work forever. Everyone except Hari Seldon. As the great scienctific thinker of his age Seldon could not be ignored. Reluctantly, the Commission of Public Safety agreed to finance the Seldon Plan. The coming disaster was predicted by Seldon's advances in psychohistory, the mathematics of very large human numbers, and it could not be averted. The Empire was doomed. Soon Trantor would lie in ruins. Chaos would overtake humanity. But the Seldon Plan was a long term strategy to minimize the worst of what was to come.

Named the best series of all time by the Hugo Awards, the Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov unquestionably comprise one of the great masterworks of science fiction, unsurpassed for its unique blend of nonstop action, daring ideas, and extensive world-building. Now, all seven volumes are together for the first time in this essential eBook bundle: FOUNDATION FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE SECOND FOUNDATION FOUNDATION\u2019S EDGE FOUNDATION AND EARTH PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION FORWARD THE FOUNDATION For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. Only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future\u2014a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save humanity, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire\u2014both scientists and scholars\u2014and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls this sanctuary the Foundation. But soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding Empire. And mankind\u2019s last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and live as slaves\u2014or take a stand for freedom and risk total destruction. Praise for Isaac Asimov and his Foundation series \u201cA true polymath, a superb rationalist, an exciting and accessible writer in both fiction and nonfiction, Isaac Asimov was simply a master of all he surveyed.\u201d\u2014Greg Bear \u201cAsimov served wondrous meals-of-the-mind to a civilization that was starved for clear thinking about the future. To this day, his visions spice our ongoing dinner-table conversation about human destiny.\u201d\u2014David Brin \u201cIsaac was still in his teens when I met him, a fan of mine before I was a fan of his. Writing for John W. Campbell back in the famous \u2018golden age of science fiction,\u2019 he became one of the founders of our field. With the Robot stories and the Foundation stories, he helped to shape science fiction as we know it.\u201d\u2014Jack Williamson \u201cI grew up on the ABC\u2019s of science fiction\u2014Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke. There\u2019s a reason Asimov\u2019s name comes first, and not just because of the alphabet!\u201d\u2014Janis Ian \u201cWith his fertile imagination, his wit, and his prolific output, Isaac Asimov truly laid the foundation for all future generations of science fiction writers.\u201d\u2014Kevin J. Anderson \u201cIf anything can be said to have been the launch pad for space-age science fiction, it has to be the Foundation trilogy. It\u2019s a classic. And it\u2019s unforgettable.\u201d\u2014Jack McDevitt \u201cThe Foundation series is one of the masterpieces of science fiction.

For no one is sure where the planet of Gaia\u2019s first settlers is to be found in the immense wilderness of the Galaxy. Nor can anyone explain why no record of Earth has been preserved, no mention of it made anywhere in Gaia\u2019s vast world-memory. It is an enigma Trevize is determined to resolve, and a quest he is determined to undertake, at any cost.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780553900941"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0553900943"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 448, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 1, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.9.9.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QoI6QptJvrYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QoI6QptJvrYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QoI6QptJvrYC&dq=intitle:Foundation+Series+inauthor:Isaac+Asimov&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QoI6QptJvrYC&dq=intitle:Foundation+Series+inauthor:Isaac+Asimov&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Foundation_and_Earth.html?hl=&id=QoI6QptJvrYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QoI6QptJvrYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The fifth novel in Isaac Asimov\u2019s classic science-fiction masterpiece, the Foundation series Golan Trevize, former Councilman of the First Foundation, has chosen the future, and it is Gaia."}}]
