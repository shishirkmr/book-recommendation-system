When a group of schoolboys are stranded on a desert island, what could go wrong? 'One of my favorite books - I read it every couple of years.' (Suzanne Collins, author of The Hunger Games) A plane crashes on a desert island. The only survivors are a group of schoolboys. By day, they discover fantastic wildlife and dazzling beaches, learning to survive; at night, they are haunted by nightmares of a primitive beast. Orphaned by society, it isn't long before their innocent childhood games devolve into a savage, murderous hunt ... 'Stands out mightily in my memory ... Such a strong statement about the human heart.' (Patricia Cornwell) 'Terrifying and haunting.' (Kingsley Amis) 'Beautifully written, tragic and provocative.' (E. M. Forster) ONE OF THE BBC'S ICONIC 'NOVELS THAT SHAPED OUR WORLD' What readers are saying: 'Every real human being should read this ... This is what we are.' 'It's brilliant, it's captivating, it's thought provoking and brutal and for some, its truly terrifying.' 'It can be read and re-read many times, and every time something new will appear.' 'There is a reason why this is studied at school ... Excellent read.' 'This is one of the few books I've read that I keep on my Kindle to read again.' 'I revisit this every few years and it's always fresh and impressive ... One of the best books I've ever read.'", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780571267385"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0571267386"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 176, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.4.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lG8dzWV28jsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lG8dzWV28jsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lG8dzWV28jsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Lord+of+the+Flies+inauthor:William+Golding&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lG8dzWV28jsC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lG8dzWV28jsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 399, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 215.46, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lG8dzWV28jsC&rdid=book-lG8dzWV28jsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 399000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 215460000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Lord_of_the_Flies-sample-epub.acsm?id=lG8dzWV28jsC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Lord_of_the_Flies-sample-pdf.acsm?id=lG8dzWV28jsC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lG8dzWV28jsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "&#39; &#39;It can be read and re-read many times, and every time something new will appear.&#39; &#39;There is a reason why this is studied at school ...
