I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings captures the longing of lonely children, the brute insult of bigotry, and the wonder of words that can make the world right. Maya Angelou\u2019s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved worldwide. Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local \u201cpowhitetrash.\u201d At eight years old and back at her mother\u2019s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age\u2014and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (\u201cI met and fell in love with William Shakespeare\u201d) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned. Poetic and powerful, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read. \u201cI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings liberates the reader into life simply because Maya Angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity.\u201d\u2014James Baldwin From the Paperback edition.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780307477729"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "030747772X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 3252, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z2q_1A0nlvIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z2q_1A0nlvIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Z2q_1A0nlvIC&dq=intitle:I+Know+Why+the+Caged+Bird+Sings+inauthor:Maya+Angelou&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Z2q_1A0nlvIC&dq=intitle:I+Know+Why+the+Caged+Bird+Sings+inauthor:Maya+Angelou&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/I_Know_Why_the_Caged_Bird_Sings.html?hl=&id=Z2q_1A0nlvIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Z2q_1A0nlvIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Here is a book as joyous and painful, as mysterious and memorable, as childhood itself."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "IiVVPgAACAAJ", "etag": "Hp/mEoM5V78", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/IiVVPgAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", "authors": ["Jerry Oster", "Maya Angelou", "Matt Blanchard"], "publisher": "Spark Publishing Group", "publishedDate": "2003", "description": "Maya Angelou's memoir I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings has fascinated readers for decades with its rare combination of stunningly beautiful writing and unflinching exploration of the rifts that divide America.
