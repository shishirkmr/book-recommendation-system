R. R. Tolkien. Gurney's premise \u2014 of an undiscovered island where a race of mystical humans co-exists in harmony with intelligent dinosaurs \u2014 has been since reiterated over and over in numerous films and by scores of other writers. Now, Calla Editions brings Gurney's spectacular artistry to a new generation in this 20th anniversary edition. Digitally re-rendered from the original transparencies, Gurney's dramatic panoramas of Dinotopia and close-up character studies of its inhabitants \u2014 both human and saurian \u2014 take on new vitality. And as a tale of high adventure and discovery told as entries and sketches in journal form, Dinotopia presents a shipwrecked visitor's glimpse into an imagined social order, a culture, and even a cooperative interspecies technology that will satisfy lovers of fantasy and science fiction of all persuasions. This edition includes a new Afterword written by author James Gurney as well as a special section of behind-the-scenes studies and maquettes he used in developing his paintings. This signed, numbered edition, limited to 250 copies, includes a deluxe slipcase.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781606600238"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1606600230"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 192, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=246EDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=246EDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=246EDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Dinotopia:+A+Land+Apart+from+Time+inauthor:James+Gurney&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=246EDQAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:Dinotopia:+A+Land+Apart+from+Time+inauthor:James+Gurney&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Dinotopia_Limited_Edition.html?hl=&id=246EDQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=246EDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This edition includes a new Afterword written by author James Gurney as well as a special section of behind-the-scenes studies and maquettes he used in developing his paintings."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "WhskDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "6v7tNYYxqqk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WhskDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Dinotopia: Journey To Chandara", "authors": ["James Gurney"], "publisher": "Courier Dover Publications", "publishedDate": "2017-07-24", "description": "Professor Denison and Bix, his dinosaur companion, are summoned to the forbidden empire of Chandara but, having lost their invitation, must travel penniless and in disguise through spectacular sights and memorable scenes.
