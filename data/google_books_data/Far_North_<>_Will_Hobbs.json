Below is the spectacular Nahanni River -- wall-to-wall whitewater racing between sheer cliffs and plunging over Virginia Falls. The pilot sets the plane down on the lake-like surface of the upper river for a closer look at the thundering falls. Suddenly the engine quits. The only sound is a dull roar downstream, as the Cessna drifts helplessly toward the falls . . . With the brutal subarctic winter fast approaching, Gabe and Raymond soon find themselves stranded in Deadmen Valley. Trapped in a frozen world of moose, wolves, and bears, two boys from vastly different cultures come to depend on each other for their very survival.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "006196364X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061963643"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 224, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Juvenile Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 16, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.7.6.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TccsLy1U_fUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TccsLy1U_fUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=TccsLy1U_fUC&pg=PP1&dq=intitle:Far+North+inauthor:Will+Hobbs&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TccsLy1U_fUC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TccsLy1U_fUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 317.37, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 222.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TccsLy1U_fUC&rdid=book-TccsLy1U_fUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 317370000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 222160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Far_North-sample-epub.acsm?id=TccsLy1U_fUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=TccsLy1U_fUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "From the window of the small floatplane, fifteen-year-old Gabe Rogers is getting his first look at Canada&#39;s magnificent Northwest Territories with Raymond Providence, his roommate from boarding school."}}]
