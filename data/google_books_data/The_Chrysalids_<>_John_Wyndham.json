When they were published, some were bestsellers, some were considered scandalous, and others were simply misunderstood. All represent their time and helped define their generation, while today each is considered a landmark work of storytelling. First published in 1955, The Chrysalids is a post-nuclear story of genetic mutation in a devastated world, which tells of the lengths the intolerant will go to to keep themselves pure. David Strorm's father doesn't approve of Angus Morton's unusually large horses, calling them blasphemies against nature. Little does he realize that his own son, his niece Rosalind and their friends, have their own secret aberration which would label them as mutants. But as David and Rosalind grow older it becomes more difficult to conceal their differences from the village elders. Soon they face a choice: wait for eventual discovery or flee to the terrifying and mutable Badlands ...", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780241950609"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0241950600"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 224, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 7, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.11.9.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z9A-GV6HvlwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z9A-GV6HvlwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Z9A-GV6HvlwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:The+Chrysalids+inauthor:John+Wyndham&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z9A-GV6HvlwC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z9A-GV6HvlwC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 500.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 250.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z9A-GV6HvlwC&rdid=book-Z9A-GV6HvlwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 500320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 250160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Chrysalids-sample-epub.acsm?id=Z9A-GV6HvlwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Z9A-GV6HvlwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Penguin Decades bring you the novels that helped shape modern Britain."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Ub1pNAAACAAJ", "etag": "EivwQTo1GEQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Ub1pNAAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Chrysalids", "authors": ["John Wyndham"], "publishedDate": "1975", "description": "\"Long, long ago lived the Old People. No one knew just how long ago - perhaps two thousand years. We knew that they had many things we no longer had, like mines and high-powered engines and machines.

Our world was divided into two parts. We lived in a land called Labrador. We had farms and fished in the sea. The sea lay round the north and east of Labrador.
