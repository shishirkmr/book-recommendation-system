Choosing to work at \"The Club\" sounds like fun, until he arrives at what turns out to be a soup kitchen for the homeless. It is here that he meets Sarge, the pipe-wielding homeless man who saved Ian from a near-mugging. His real name is Jacques, and he was a soldier in the Canadian Armed Forces. His last tour of duty was as a peacekeeper stationed in Rwanda, an African nation Ian knows little about. What he learns will change Ian's view of the world--and may just help Jacques, too. With a Foreword by Lieutenant-General Romeo Dallaire (Ret'd), force commander for the United Nations Mission to Rwanda, \"Shattered\" is an unforgettable story, one that asks what one person can do to make a difference.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0143187791"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780143187790"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Genocide"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YW8_NAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YW8_NAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YW8_NAEACAAJ&dq=intitle:Shattered+inauthor:Eric+Walters&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YW8_NAEACAAJ&dq=intitle:Shattered+inauthor:Eric+Walters&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Shattered.html?hl=&id=YW8_NAEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YW8_NAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "With a Foreword by Lieutenant-General Rom\u00e9o Dallaire (Ret&#39;d), force commander for the United Nations Mission to Rwanda, Shattered is an unforgettable story, one that asks what one person can do to make a difference."}}]
