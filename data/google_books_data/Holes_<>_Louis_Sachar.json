Hilarious, inventive and wonderfully compelling, this is an unmissable modern classic. WINNER OF THE NEWBERY MEDAL WINNER OF THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD Stanley Yelnats' family has a history of bad luck, so when a miscarriage of justice sends him to Camp Green Lake Juvenile Detention Centre (which isn't green and doesn't have a lake) he is not surprised. Every day he and the other inmates are told to dig a hole, five foot wide by five foot deep, reporting anything they find. Why? The evil warden claims that it's character building, but this is a lie. It's up to Stanley to dig up the truth. Witty, inventive and completely unique, this is a masterpiece of storytelling that combines sly humour with irresistible, page-turning writing.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781408810279"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1408810271"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Young Adult Fiction"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 65, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.17.14.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vlJw20OoYqUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vlJw20OoYqUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vlJw20OoYqUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Holes+inauthor:Louis+Sachar&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vlJw20OoYqUC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vlJw20OoYqUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 399, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 279.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vlJw20OoYqUC&rdid=book-vlJw20OoYqUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 399000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 279300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Holes-sample-epub.acsm?id=vlJw20OoYqUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Holes-sample-pdf.acsm?id=vlJw20OoYqUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vlJw20OoYqUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The iconic multi-million bestselling novel from Louis Sachar.
