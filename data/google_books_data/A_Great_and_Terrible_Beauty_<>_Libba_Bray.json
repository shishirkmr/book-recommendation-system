Lonely, guilt-ridden, and prone to visions of the future that have an uncomfortable habit of coming true, Gemma's reception there is a chilly one. To make things worse, she's being followed by a mysterious young Indian man, a man sent to watch her. But why? What is her destiny? And what will her entanglement with Spence's most powerful girls - and their foray into the spiritual world - lead to?", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780731814909"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0731814908"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 416, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Juvenile Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 250, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.3.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HcEjwi1cZO0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HcEjwi1cZO0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HcEjwi1cZO0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:A+Great+and+Terrible+Beauty+inauthor:Libba+Bray&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HcEjwi1cZO0C&dq=intitle:A+Great+and+Terrible+Beauty+inauthor:Libba+Bray&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Great_and_Terrible_Beauty.html?hl=&id=HcEjwi1cZO0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/A_Great_and_Terrible_Beauty-sample-epub.acsm?id=HcEjwi1cZO0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=HcEjwi1cZO0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "It&#39;s 1895, and after the death of her mother, 16-year-old Gemma Doyle is shipped off from the life she knows in India to Spence, a proper boarding school in England."}}]
