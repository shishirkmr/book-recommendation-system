That is, when we were splitting up for the first time. It was two summers ago when they first worked their magic, and last summer when they shook up our lives once again. You see, we don\u2019t wear the Pants year-round. We let them rest so they are extra powerful when summer comes. (There was the time this spring when Carmen wore them to her mom\u2019s wedding, but that was a special case.) Now we\u2019re facing our last summer together. In September we go to college. And it\u2019s not like one of those TV shows where all of us magically turn up at the same college. We\u2019re going to four different colleges in four different cities (but all within four hours of one another\u2014that was our one rule). We\u2019re headed off to start our real lives. Tomorrow night at Gilda\u2019s we\u2019ll launch the Pants on their third summer voyage. Tomorrow begins the time of our lives. It\u2019s when we\u2019ll need our Pants the most.
