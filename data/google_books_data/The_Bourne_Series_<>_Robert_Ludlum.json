After Bourne is ambushed and nearly killed while in Indonesia, he fakes his death to take on a new identity and mission: to find out who is trying to assassinate him. The search leads Bourne to question who he really is and what he would become if he no longer carried the Bourne identity.

A massive global team lead by Soraya Moore is assembled to investigate the attack before the situation escalates. When Bourne's search for his would-be assassin intersects with Soraya's search for the group behind the airplane bombing, Bourne is thrust into a race to prevent a new world war.
